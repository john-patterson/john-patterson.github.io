### Overview

On the side of my primary occupation as a Software Engineer, I am trying to grow a business as a freelance writer. My hobby areas for research include: running, weightlifting, biking, urban design, transit planning, Seattle events and culture, fermented foods and beverages, software engineering, programming language design, and literature. Don't worry, I'll work on pairing that list down for you.

Expect a list of brilliant prose samples to appear below in the near future.
