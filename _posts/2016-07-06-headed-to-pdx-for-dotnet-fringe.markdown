My trip was approved through Acadian and I'll be leaving this Saturday for Portland! I have been studying F# over the past week in preparation, mostly by reading [F# for fun and profit][fsharpforfunandprofit] and working through the [99 Haskell problems][99problems] for F#. Hoping to pick up some tips for F# in production over the conference.
