Hey! My name is John. I just moved to the beautiful PNW from South Louisiana. I have a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Computer Science. I'm a polyglot programmer with a penchant for functional programming languages. 

Off the silicon court, I enjoy hiking, weightlifting, stand-up, and boardgames (long walks on the beach are also cool).
