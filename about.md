Hey! My name is John.

I'm a backend developer in Seattle, though I'm looking to relocated to The Netherlands. Compilers, functional programming languages, and data science excite me. I would also like to learn more about urban and transportation planning and how technology can be used to improve the urban landscape.

My current pet project is a roguelike game I am working on along with my friend. Once it is further along, I'll add it to my software list.

Aside from software engineering, exercise fuels me. I help organize a run club in Seattle with ~20 or so recurring runners. Literature has been an interest of mine through my life and in 2019 I wrote 2 novel manuscripts. Editing them has been significantly slower. Finallly, I like studying languages. English is my native language and I know a bit of Spanish and German. Currently, I am studying Dutch.
