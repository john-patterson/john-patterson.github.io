Hey! My name is John. I recently graduated from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Computer Science. Right now I really like reading about and trying out new programming languages. 

Off the silicon court, I enjoy hiking, weightlifting, and am trying to get back into drawing.
