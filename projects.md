### Projects

[**Passcal**](https://github.com/john-patterson/passcal) (Python)

Following along to the [Let's Build A Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) series by Ruslan Spivak. Implementation of the Pascal language in Python. With unit-tests! You should check out Ruslan's site if you haven't, he's got a lot of good series on making neat tools from scratch.


[**Wavvy**](https://github.com/john-patterson/wavvy) (Python)

Dashboard for Wave API enabled thermostat at the office. Intended to collect data on the changing of the thermostat to find the best configuration for both rooms. Acadian just called the AC company to come and fix it, instead.

[**The Pit VR**](https://github.com/john-patterson/Build-A-Bridge) (C#/Unity)

First Unity project for VR class. Integrates a Kinect V2, a Leap Motion controller, and an Oculus DK2 HMD using the RUIS VR toolkit. User places a bridge using the Leap and is then forced to walk along the bridge they made.

### Presentations

Presentation I originally gave for the Acadian Software Group in Lafayette, LA on Feburary 8th, 2017. Gentle introduction to what functional programming and F# have to offer.
